## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
p span {
  background-color: var(--yellow);
  padding: 4px 12px;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: clamp(.75rem, 2vw, .875rem);
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```
### Continued development

I would like more practice creating responsive pages without always relying on media queries.
